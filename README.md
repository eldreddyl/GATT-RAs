The GATT-RAs repository (repo) serves two purposes:
1. Training and _coding sandbox_ for RAs on the "Quantifying GATT Trade Liberalization" project.
   - A _coding sandbox_ is a testing environment that is isolated from substantive work that allows for learning and experimentation without the potential for harm to the substantive work
   - Start by clicking on the "Issues" tab above and sort it by "Oldest." Then follow the directions for each issue in order.
2. This is where RAs will post their daily hours and reflections.
   - Unless explicitly agreed otherwise, daily hours and reflections will be posted via a file named "insert_your_first_name_here.rmd" that has been created for you in the repo.
   - You will update the file at the end of each workday and then submit it as a pull request in this repo.
