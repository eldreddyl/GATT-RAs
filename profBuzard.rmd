  - Hours worked this week: 3h 53m
- **Reflection**: It was really exciting to finally get Beamer slides working with knitr from a .Rmd. I'm proud of the issue-based flow I created for the Github trainings for the RAs. Had a good meeting with Matt on direction of the work for 1962 --> Uruguay round.
